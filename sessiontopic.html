    <p>There are four ways to associate styles with your HTML document. most commonly method used are inline CSS and External CSS</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Embedded CSS-</b><br>you can put your CSS rules into an HTML document using the style element. this tag is placed inside head tag.rule defined using this syntax will be applied to all the elements available in the document.</li>
        <li><b>Inline CSS-</b><br>you can use style attributes of any HTML element to define style rules . thes rules will be applied to that element only. </li>
        <li><b>External CSS-</b><br><ul><li>
            The link element can be used to an external stylesheet file in your HTML document
        </li><li>An external style sheet is a separate test file with .CCS extention. you define all the style rules within this text file and then you can include this file in any HTNL doucement using link element.</li></ul></li>
